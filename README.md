Website for the Official Liverpool FC Supporters Club in Carlsbad, California

# History of the site
I'm the vice president and one of the original members of the Official Liverpool FC Supporters Club in Carlsbad, California. Established in 2016, we are one of the smaller supporters clubs for one of the most highly decorated soccer teams in the world, Liverpool FC, so aside from our social media presence, there isn't that much known about our group. This website is designed to give us more visibility and attract supporters who may be in the area to join the group for a game when we are able to meet.
